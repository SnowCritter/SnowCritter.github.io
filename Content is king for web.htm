    <h3>Part 1: If you build it, they will come.</h3>
    <p>The world is composed of experiences. This is not a statement of ideal, but an ecological inevitability. 
      That which is experienced is perpetuated, and passed on. Media, marketing, culture, can all be tracked and modeled as 
      a genealogy. I was originally an ecologist, and the perspective of ecological models I cultivated is endlessly applicable 
      to all things in the world. There are certain shelling points that, given enough time to adapt and optimize, marketing will 
      fall into. Niches that once filled, change the shape of the landscape and open or close new niches. Competition, while 
      through the proxy of competing interests or companies or corporations, is really between ideas. Ideas converging and 
      pushing out the inefficient organisms until only the most fit for their niche remains.</p>
    <p>Many of the odd and unintuitive quirks of biology then, remain in abstracted social systems. 
      It is not the best advertisement that succeeds. Not the most moral, or evocative or funny or “true”. 
      It's not even the one that makes the most money. Just like life, the strategies that survive are the 
      ones that most successfully reproduce themselves.</p>
    <p>Humans have done alright for ourselves, but it’s the ants and the worms that really sit atop the throne of biology. 
      The most successful animals. If we get our act together and get into space, we might be vindicated in a few billion 
      years when the sun explodes, but for now, we bow to the bug.</p>
    <p>So, to tell what media will reign, you look at the factors that allow it to reproduce, and the environment it exists in. 
      Making money is only one part of that equation. Production cost is another key one.</p>
    <p>I recently discovered a phenomenon on YouTube. An animated video of a marble race, like those little tracks you 
      used to make as a kid, just a few colored circles spinning and bouncing down a track. It had millions of views. 
      The channel making it had hundreds of videos. It was a whole community. Dozens and dozens of varieties. I did some 
      napkin math, the number of channels, the number of views and videos. Hundreds of thousands of dollars flow through here, 
      maybe millions. The content was simple and mass produced. A single program ran over and over, it could be dozens of videos 
      before the track was changed or a new element appeared.</p>
    <p>I found it fascinating. There was no narrative drawing people back, there was no idea 
      being developed or issue resolved. It was almost like a sensory video, just raw stimulus. 
      And it was wildly successful.</p>
    <p>Again and again I find that to be successful as a source of media, quality is far far less important than presence. 
      To be successful as a steamer, the most important thing is to stream. To grow a YouTube channel you have to be putting out 
      videos regularly. Your content must reproduce, and you are a vehicle of its reproduction. If you make it, if you keep making 
      it, eventually you will succeed.</p>
